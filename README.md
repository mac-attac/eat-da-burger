# Eat Da Burger

## Description

Eat Da Burger is a foodie app that allows users to enter in the names of burgers they would like to chow down on! A user is able to enter in the name of the burger they desire and whether or not they would like to eat it now or save it for later. Depending on input, the burger is placed in the devoured column on the left or the save it for later queue on the right. At the click of a button on either side, the user can choose to devour the burger of their choice or re-order it to send it back into the "save for later" queue. All burgers are stored in the database, whether eaten immediately or saved for later.

Like many others, I enjoy food and am always looking forward to my next meal. Nothing compares to a juicy burger. This app helps to keep your cravings alive by queueing up your cravings.
